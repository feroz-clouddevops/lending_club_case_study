- This project is an assignment submission for Upgrad AI & ML course.
- The dataset used is the loan dataset provided by upgrad.

## Conclusions
- Number of defaulters are more for shorter term loans(36 months), compared to longer term loans.
- Applicants with employment length of less than or equal to 1 year & employees with 10 years of employment are the highest potential defaulters.
- While longer employment length might sound intuitive, but it cannot be concluded that applicants with longer employment length end up fully repaying the loan.
- Higher annual incomes applicants should be considered for ’home improvement’ loan approval.
- Even lower annual incomes applicants can be considered for ’education’ loan approval.
- Lower annual income applicants applying for lower loan amounts tend to default more.
- Loan applicants with higher annual income are slightly better candidates for loan approval.
- Employees working for longer years cannot be considered as strong candidates for higher loan amounts.
- Higher loan amount applications end up defaulting more.
- It is better to consider applicants with ‘OWN’ houses for approval.
- It cannot be concluded that ‘debt consolidation’ loan purpose will end up defaulting more.
